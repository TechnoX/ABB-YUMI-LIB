# ABB RAPID UTILITY LIBRARY

## A collection of utility modules for ABB industrial robots.

The purpose of this repo is to create a take away library for everyone to use in their robot programming projects.

### Help
If you like to contribute to this library, please send a pull request and I will probably add it to the collection. Your code should be readable, nice and tidy.

### No guarantees
All code comes "AS IS", and its your responsibility to check for errors before you use it in a production environment. If you find errors, please let me know.
