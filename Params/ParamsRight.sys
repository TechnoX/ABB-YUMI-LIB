    !* A module just containing variables that are specific   *
    !* for the right arm. This is used like a C-like struct   *
    !* or something similar. This module should NOT contain   *
    !* any routines. Nothing else except raw parameters.      *
    !* Of course we strive to have as few individual          *
    !* parameters as possible                                 *
